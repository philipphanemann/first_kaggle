These are possible topics to tackle on kaggle.

## Epilepsy - time series forecasting
    The challenge is to distinguish between ten minute long data clips covering an hour prior to a seizure, and ten minute iEEG clips of interictal activity.

- 1st place - $10,000
- 2nd place - $6,000
- 3rd place - $4,000


    Seizure forecasting systems have the potential to help patients with epilepsy lead more normal lives. Computational algorithms must reliably identify periods of increased probability of seizure occurrence. The current contest focuses on seizure prediction using long-term electrical brain activity recordings from humans obtained from the world-first clinical trial of the implantable NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System

## Santander - recommender system

    Santander is challenging Kagglers to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

- 1st place - $30,000
- 2nd place - $20,000
- 3rd place - $10,000


    Under their current system, a small number of Santanderâ€™s customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer experience. Support needs for a range of financial decisions.
